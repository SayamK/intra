<h1 class="new">About Us</h1>
<p class="new-p">We, the computer club of DPS Rohini comprise of die hard fanatics of technology whose passion for the technological science verges on borderline crazy. We comprise of 25+ brilliant minds, each posessing a unique perspective of analysing the world around us.

"When all think alike, then no one is thinking." We value different ideas, dreams and aspirations of our members and work our best to turn those dreams into reality. "It isn't the incompetent who destroy an organization. The incompetent never get in a position to destroy it. It is those who achieved something and want to rest upon their achievements who are forever clogging things up". We appreciate our achievements but never stop our crusade to acheive long lasting glory in the field of technological sciences. We have taken the competition scene in Delhi by storm, winning innummerable events but never letting it get in our way of learning.

Feel free to join us and give yourself an opportunity to explore the unexplored, to think of the unthinkable and to do the impossible.</p>
